**IF YOU'VE COME HERE TO FIND ANSWERS TO THE PUZZLES:** At present, none of the puzzles in _The Search for the Secret Sapphire_ are designed with the intention of the player coming here to the source code to solve them. There are hints to all of the puzzles on the game's itch.io page. That being said, solving the puzzles in a meta way is very much in the spirit of this game, so do as you will and good luck finding the Sapphire!

## Development Progress

**DISCLAIMER: THIS CODE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS!** This was a month-long game jam, but it was a relatively ambitious project for me, so a lot of corners were cut to get it done in time. This meant that much of the standards of Good Code practice were tossed asside. I'm working on fixing this (and updating it for the post-jam build), but I've created a few branches to preserve the energy of the game jam version of the code in case people are interested: 

- [Code at time of game submission](https://github.com/conor-wilson/gameoff2024/tree/code-at-time-of-submission)
- [Code at time of mid-jam patch](https://github.com/conor-wilson/gameoff2024/tree/mid-jam-patch) - This includes some game-breaking bug fixes.
- [Post-Jam code](https://github.com/conor-wilson/gameoff2024) - This is the main branch and is still under development. It includes post-jam tidy-ups and fixes.

## Game Description: 

A point-and-click adventure puzzle game (with a twist)... Lost in a haunted mansion without a hope of escape, the only way out is in. Will you find the Secret Sapphire and cure the curse?  

**DEV'S NOTE:** The above assumes that you are able to start the game. If the start-button breaks, the HELP BOT should be able to assist you. That shouldn't happen though. Probably.

**------ THIS GAME IS BEST PLAYED WITH A MOUSE RATHER THAN A TRACK-PAD -------**

This was made in 30 days as my submission for the GitHub Game Off 2024: "SECRETS"! [[Link to Submission Page]](https://itch.io/jam/game-off-2024/rate/3149163)

_**SPOILER:** The point-and-click adventure actually takes place inside of the menu of "The Search for the Secret Sapphire". Your goal is to fix the start button and finally get to play the game._

### Puzzle Hints
If you're struggling with some of the puzzles, here's a couple of hints to help you along :) 

- **Username Puzzle Hint:** Have a look around the main menu screen, I'm sure I must have credited myself with my username somewhere there...
- **Password Puzzle Hint:** There might be a useful TOOL in the menu somewhere that could help you find a clue for the password. Once you've found the clue, you might find some more information if you CLICK on everything, be it moving or STATIC. This puzzle could have been clearer, but I just spent so long looking at pictures of TURTLEs that I ran out of time...
- **S Puzzle Hint:** I've been working on another game called HammerMan. It's pretty basic, but something weird has happened, there's a character that showed up in the game that I didn't intend on being there... It's sort of shaped like a snake with legs??
- **T1 Puzzle Hint:** That HammerMan sure has a knack for getting in places he was never intended to... he's even able to break the edges of my screen and run on top of the windows on my desktop!
- **A Puzzle Hint:** If there's one thing I love more than turtles, it's memes about turtles. If only there was a way to help out the turtle in the meme on my desktop... Maybe some other program on my computer can give me something that will help? (Make sure that you help the meme turtle completely, as it will give you a tool that's required to solve a later puzzle)
- **R Puzzle Hint:** I wonder where that pesky letter R got to... You might need to start thinking outside of (or rather, on top of) the box for this one...
- **T2 Puzzle Hint:** I find the best tools can be found on the fringes of the game world. Tools like these really change your perspective and allow you to zoom out and see the bigger picture. You might even find something mysterious in the void. Luckily for me, I'm able to remember secrets like these by leaving hints for them on stickynotes.
- **Finale Puzzle Hint:** I'm afraid that you're at the mercy of the HELP BOT. They are immune to anything that is found within the game. Although... maybe there's something (or someone) from a DIFFERENT game that might be able to do some damage...
- **Secret Sapphire Puzzle Hint:** I like turtles...
